# ChemDataScraper

8/25/2020

This is a data scraper to basically pull chemical data for lab reports. This is forked from the amazing pubchem & explained with the inchiTRUST tutorial. (https://www.inchi-trust.org/inchi-post/chemistry-programming-with-python-retrieving-inchi-from-pubchem-tutorial/) 

My goal is to upload this for now, then eventually tweak a few functions to get some more data to make lab reports easier. Instead of cmd+f an entire pubchem page, simply run this script & enter chemical of interest to retreive molecular weight, alternate names, SDS data & physical properties. 

Stay tuned for more of this project & hopefully I can finish this up soon to make lab reports a little faster. 

Likewise, if you're a student with no idea about how to run this, send me an email: info@kruer.io 
I am always happy to help

Feeling generous? buy me a coffee or maybe an MCAT textbook : )
