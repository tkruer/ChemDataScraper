# ChemDataScraper

8/26/2020

This is a data scraper to basically pull chemical data for lab reports. This is forked from the amazing pubchem & explained with the inchiTRUST tutorial, so all credit to them. (https://www.inchi-trust.org/inchi-post/chemistry-programming-with-python-retrieving-inchi-from-pubchem-tutorial/) & (https://pubchemdocs.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pug-rest)

Right now it can do the following, due to the limitations of the PubChem API: InChi, InChiKey, Moleulcar Formula, Smiles, Molecular Weight, IUPAC Name, Charge and, Mass for Mass spectrometry. 

Likewise, if you're a student with no idea about how to run this, send me an email: info@kruer.io 
I am always happy to help

Feeling generous? buy me a coffee or maybe an MCAT textbook : )
